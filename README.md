NSFW Image Detection Script
This project provides a Python script for detecting NSFW (Not Safe For Work) images using the Hugging Face Inference API. The nsfw_image_detection.py script allows users to classify images as "NSFW" or "SFW" (Safe For Work) by uploading them to a pre-trained model hosted on Hugging Face.

Prerequisites
Python 3.7+
API Access to Hugging Face: Requires a Hugging Face account and an API key.
Python Packages:
requests - For making HTTP requests.
python-dotenv - For loading environment variables from a .env file.
You can install required packages with the following command:

bash
Copy code
pip install requests python-dotenv
Setup
Clone the Repository or download the nsfw_image_detection.py file to your local environment.

Create a .env File in the same directory as the script and add your Hugging Face API key:

plaintext
Copy code
HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY=your_huggingface_api_key
Replace your_huggingface_api_key with the actual API key from your Hugging Face account. This key provides access to the API for image detection.

Set Up a Test Image: Place a sample image in the same directory or specify the full path to an image file to test the script.

Usage
To run the nsfw_image_detection.py script and check if an image is NSFW, use the following command:

bash
Copy code
python nsfw_image_detection.py
In the script, specify the path to an image file for testing:

python
Copy code
# Update the image path
test_image_path = "path/to/your/image.jpg"  # Replace with the actual image path
When you run the script, it will send the image to the Hugging Face API and return "Yes" if the image is NSFW or "No" if it is SFW.

Troubleshooting
400 Client Error: If you encounter a 400 error, check the following:
Verify the API URL and ensure the model is publicly accessible.
Ensure that the image path is correct and that the image file exists.
Confirm that the API key in .env is correct and has the required permissions.
Environment Variable Issues: If the API key is not being recognized, ensure you have installed python-dotenv and that .env is in the same directory as nsfw_image_detection.py.
